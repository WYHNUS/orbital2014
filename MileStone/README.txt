project's ideation :

This project originated from an unfulfilled desire YanHao had during last school vacation - to play DOTA anytime, anywhere!

C-DOTA tries to combine DOTA's RPG (Role Play Game) and RTS (Real Time Strategy) components with SLG (Simulation Game) such as Hero of Might and Magic, the result would be SLG but in DOTA-like map and the player will enjoy this game by selecting and controlling one of the DOTA-like heroes.

Players can enjoy this DOTA-like game environment without have to be 100% concentrated in the game!



Targeted audience:

DOTAers who would like to play DOTA even when 
1. they do not have the time to sit down in front of the computer for a long period of time, 
2. they are on bus, train or plane, unable to be fully concentrated,
3. they do not have computers or internet connection,
4. they would like to play dota-like game but in a more relaxing way,
5. they can pause and unpause the game any time they want,
6. they can play the DOTA-like game and do other stuffs at the same time!

*Answering questions raised in the first MileStone:

Centauri:
DOTA players generally would want to play against other players, which would occur online.

Answer:
All online games start with single player game. 
Besides, if people really have the time, they would play DOTA instead of other "dota-like" games...


J&Q:
I just wonder will that violet the copyright of the original DOTA game. and will the games of DOTA be willing to accept a new version of the game?

Answer:
Not sure, but I don't think copyright is an issue if, later on, we alter the map and character image, names, etc.
Look at LOL and other dota-like mobile apps, you will get my point XD
