project's ideation :

This project originated from an unfulfilled desire YanHao had during last school vacation - to play DOTA anytime, anywhere, even without computers and internet connection, even when you are taking a bus.

C-DOTA tries to combine DOTA's RPG (Role Play Game) and RTS (Real Time Strategy) components with SLG (Simulation Game) such as Hero of Might and Magic, the result would be SLG but in DOTA-like map and the player will enjoy this game by selecting and controlling one of the DOTA-like heroes.

Players can enjoy this DOTA-like game environment without have to be 100% concentrated in the game!
