Game Description: (from wiki XD)

DotA pits two teams of players against each other: the Sentinel and the Scourge. 
Players on the Sentinel team are based at the southwest corner of the map, and those on the Scourge team are based at the northeast corner. 
Each base is defended by towers and waves of units which guard the main paths leading to their base.
In the center of each base is the "Ancient", a building that must be destroyed to win the game.




(all the constants used are defined at the end of the file)

Game Flow:

1. Player select a hero from a fixed hero pool.


There are three main types of hero, namely strength, agility and intelligence.
Each hero belongs to one of the three types, which characterizes its main attribute.


Each hero will have at least five skills depending on different hero model.



Each Hero in the game will have different:

startingStrength
startingAgility
startingIntelligence
strengthGrowth
agilityGrowth
intelligenceGrowth


totalStrength = startingStrength + strengthGrowth * level + strengthGainFromItem + strengthGainFromSkill 
totalAgility = startingAgility + agilityGrowth * level + agilityGainFromItem + agilityGainFromSkill 
totalIntelligence = startingIntelligence + intelligenceGrowth * level + intelligenceGainFromItem + intelligenceGainFromSkill 


Below are other hero's attributes determined by strength, agility and intelligence:

HP = startingHP + STRENGTH_ADD_HP_RATIO * totalStrength + HPAddFromItem + HPAddFromSkill
MP = startingMP + INTELLIGENCE_ADD_MP_RATIO * totalIntelligence + MPAddFromItem + MPAddFromSkill


HPGainPerRound = STRENGTH_ADD_HP_PER_ROUND * totalStrength + HPGainPerRoundFromItem + HPGainPerRoundFromSkill
MPGainPerRound = INTELLIGENCE_ADD_MP_PER_ROUND * totalIntelligence + MPGainPerRoundFromItem + MPGainPerRoundFromSkill


physicalDefence = startingPhysicalDefence + AGILITY_ADD_PHYSICAL_DEFENCE_RATIO * totalAgility + physicalDefenceGainFromItem + physicalDefenceGainFromSkill

physicalAttackSpeed = startingPhysicalAttackSpeed + AGILITY_ADD_PHYSICAL_ATTACK_SPEED_RATIO * totalAgility + physicalAttackSpeedGainFromItem + physicalAttackSpeedGainFromSkill

physicalAttack = startingPhysicalAttack + (main attribute of the selected hero: strength/agility/intelligence) * MAIN_ATTRIBUTE_ADD_PHYSICAL_ATTACK_RATIO + physicalAttackGainFromItem + physicalAttackGainFromSkill 



Other Attributes hero prossess:

physicalAttackArea = initialPhysicalAttackArea 

magicResistance = initialMagicResistance + magicResistanceGainFromItem + magicResistanceGainFromSkill

movementSpeed = initialMovementSpeed + movementSpeedGainFromItem + movementSpeedGainFromSkill






2. Player controls a hero starting from a fixed grid position ([playerStartingGridXPos][playerStartingGridYPos])







3. In each round of the game, if player's hero is alive, player will have some ActionPoint(AP) to perform actions
h
AP = startingAP (fixed value)


Each action will consume a certain amount of AP depending on the hero's attributes



Actions player can perform:

3.1 Buy Item
Player can buy at most six items from a fixed item pool for their heros


3.2 Sell Item
Sell an equiped item for half of the original price


3.3 Move
Hero can move through the movable game grid frame and each movement event consumes AP
Consume AP = MIN_MOVEMENT_CONSUME_AP + (1 - movementSpeed / MAX_MOVEMENT_SPEED) * MOVEMENT_CONSUME_AP


3.4 Physocal Attack
Attack a selected target

damage = (1 - physicalDefence * 0.06 / (1 + 0.06 * physicalDefence) ) * physicalAttack

Consume AP = MIN_PHYSICAL_ATTACK_CONSUME_AP + (1 - physicalAttackSpeed / MAX_PHYSICAL_ATTACK_SPEED) * PHYSICAL_ATTACK_CONSUME_AP


3.5 Use Item
Use an equipped item
Consume AP = depends on individual item


3.6 Use Skill
Use a skill
Consume AP = depends on individual skill


3.7 










4. Other Possible Scenarios and Consequence after player performs an action:

4.1 Kill a LineCreep
Some money will be awarded to hero.

4.2 Kill a hero
Some money will be awarded to hero and the killed hero (be it controled by player or computer) will respawn after a certain round (depending on hero's level).

4.3 Destroy a tower
All friendly hero will gain a money bonus and if the tower is destroyed by a hero, this hero will have an extra money bonus.

4.4 Be killed
A certain amount of money will be deduced from the hero's money account.
The hero will respawn after a certain round (depending on hero's level) from the fixed grid position (starting grid position).

5.2 Hero's bounty experience is based on hero's level

		/*
		 * level 1 - 5 : 
		 * bounty exp : 100 / 120 / 160 / 220 / 300
		 * 
		 * level 6 - 25 : 
		 * 300 + (level - 5) * 100 
		 * 
		 */







6 LineCreep

6.1 Infomathion:  (starting attributes)
	there are three types of LineCreeps:
			BountyMoney / BountyExp / HP / MP / PhysicalAttack / Range / AttackSpeed / PhysicalDefence / MagicResis / MovementSpeed 

	1. meele : 44 / 62 / 550 / 0 / 21 / 1 / 1.0 / 2 / 25 / 325

	2. ranged : 49 / 41 / 300 / 300 / 24 / 3 / 1.0 / 0 / 25 / 325

	3. siege : 74 / 88 / 500 / 0 / 40 / 4 / 0.7 / 0 / 100 / 325


6.2 Spawn condition:
	there are three different locations (top, mid, bottom) for each team (scourge and sentinel), which makes a total of six spawn locations. (each with fixed position)

	every 10 turns, each spawn location will create a new wave of line creeps.
	each wave consists: 3 meele + 1 ranged 

	every 50 turns, each spawn location will create a new wave of line creeps with different formation.
	each wave consists: 3 meele + 1 ranged + 1 siege


6.3 LineCreeps have levels (advanced attributes)
	after every 200 rounds, meele and ranged creeps will automatically level up (maximum level : 30)

	each level will increase for 10HP and 1 physicalAttack for meele creeps
	each level will increase for 10HP and 2 physicalAttack for ranged creeps



6.4 LineCreeps SpawnPoints will increase spawning number 
	meele creeps number in each spawn point will increase by 1 after every 200 rounds (maximum 6)
	ranged creeps and siege creeps number in each spawn point will increase by 1 after every 600 rounds (maximum 2)



6.5 LineCreeps will upgrade further after corresponding barrack has been destroyed

	for each line: (top/mid/bottom)
	if meele barrack has been destroyed, meele creep will gain extra attributes: (upon 6.4)
		HP : +150 + 9 * level
		attack : +19 + level
		defence : +1

	if ranged barrack has been destroyed, ranged creep will gain extra attributes: (upon 6.4)
		HP : +175 + 8 * level
		attack : +20 + level
		defence : +1

		siege creep will gain extra attack : +16
		
	
	if all meele and ranged barracks have been destroyed for all three lines (top/mid/bottom) :
		creep level will automatically upgrade to level 30
